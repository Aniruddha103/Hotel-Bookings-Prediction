# 🏨 Hotel Booking Analysis

Explore the data, unveil patterns, and map the footprints of traveler this project dives deep into hotel booking trends using the Data_Train Dataset. Whether you're a data explorer or a business strategist, you'll find value in understanding how guests behave, where they come from, and what impacts their decisions.

## 📌 Project Overview

This notebook investigates hotel booking behaviors using Python's data science stack. It answers questions like:

- Which countries contribute most to hotel bookings?
- What types of rooms generate the highest revenue?
- How does cancellation rate vary with booking conditions?
- What is the average daily rate (ADR) trend across months?

It combines powerful visualizations with meaningful transformations to uncover insights that hotel managers and analysts can act on.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🔍 **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and filtering irrelevant rows (like bookings with zero guests).
- 📊 **Visual Analytics**: Utilizes seaborn, matplotlib, plotly, and folium for:
  - Box plots of ADR across room types and hotels
  - Choropleth maps of guest origin
  - Temporal trends in pricing and cancellations
- 🌍 **Geospatial Mapping**: Identifies guest origins using country-level visualizations.
- 📈 **Revenue & Booking Trends**: Breakdown of average daily rates across hotel types and months.
